Employee Management System

One of the best project ideas for C++ as a beginner is the employee management system. 
In this system, you need to build a complete application (mobile, phone) that has a dashboard 
describing the user’s (employee) profile, and a database that holds the record of all the data regarding users’ information.
A user can edit changes in his/her profile where all the personal details are recorded.
C++ has excellent libraries that can be used to perform operations. 
Source code allows you to add, delete, or edit the records. 
This system is the best C++ project that can be used in organizations to track records of the employees.
